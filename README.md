# clitool
Common command line user interfaces for golang.

## What is this
Sometimes I make CLI tools using golang and I wished I had following inquirers.
* list
* checkbox
* confirm
* input
* password

I also wished following user interfaces.
* progress bar
* spinner

In nodejs, there are following npm packages. And the design of its inquirers are so beautiful.
* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [cli-progress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-progress)

I implement go library that imitate them.
